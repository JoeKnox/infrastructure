just building something for the house

This is my learning project:
1. Design my network to include practical and main devices/computers, a second one for IoT, and a third to contain things that I am trying to make and break.

2.  This is also my attempt at making myself document and track things.  Getting used to writing as well.   


05/02/23- designed a base format of goals and objectives and first iteration software.

05/04/23- used go.gliffy.com (free trial version)to design the hardware and layout and todo list see network map(red-things that need done, purple-kthings that I need to learn)

5/06/23  6:30 AM Began moving the hardware from its basement location to the lab and rerouting all of the cable.   Recycled, trimmed, rerouted and terminated a all cables and cleaned up the routes/lines.  Fully tested prior to cleaning up the cable routes and paths.  One issue with connection of megans desktop computer.  It showed no internet connectivity until a google search was committed and then it came right back on-line. Ready for reallocation of resources 9:30 AM
